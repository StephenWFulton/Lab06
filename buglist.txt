*********************************BUGS******************************************

removeBack does not actually remove any nodes
removeFront does not actually remove any nodes
addBack does not add nodes to the back of list (adds them to the front instead)
isEmpty always returns true

By extension of those above not working:

The destructor does not remove the nodes from the list
